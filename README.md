# Lathish R — Portfolio (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a ready-to-edit portfolio site for **Lathish R**.
The project uses **Vite (React)** and **Tailwind CSS**. It is configured so you can:

- Edit content in `src/Portfolio.jsx`
- Replace `/public/profile.svg` with your own image (or put `profile.jpg` and update the path)
- Replace `GITHUB_URL` and `RESUME_URL` in `src/Portfolio.jsx`
- Run locally and deploy to Netlify or Vercel

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. install dependencies
npm install

# 2. run dev
npm run dev

# 3. build for production
npm run build
# production files go into the `dist/` folder
```

## Deploy to Netlify

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. On Netlify, create a new site → Import from GitHub.
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`
5. Add your domain or use the Netlify hostname.

---
If you want, I can also:
- Update the site with your actual profile picture and resume file.
- Create the GitHub repo and push it for you (if you give me the repo name).
- Convert this to a plain HTML version (no build) for even simpler hosting.
